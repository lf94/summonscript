Have a named pipe.

When script is run (saved + run), make sure to target the named pipe.

pipe receives magic bytes, data length and the model data.

libfive can then be used to render multiple sdfs into multiple meshes.

magic bytes must be long enough to make it probablistically impossible to be
misinterpreted as data.

program parses the new mesh.

if there's any loaded mesh, unload it

load the new mesh
